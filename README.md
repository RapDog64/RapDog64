## Welcome to my GitHub

Hi visitor! My name is Denis and I work as an Automation Quality Assurance Engineer. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
My career, as an automation quality assurance engineer, started with UI testing. I used Java, Maven, Selenium Webdriver, TestNG, Allure Report, and Jenkins. 
Later I've learned tools such as Rest Assured, Selenoid, Docker, and Spring. However, I didn't stop my learning and continue growing as a specialist and try new tools. In addition to that,
I created a test automation project, where I used modern technologies and tools, so here is [the link](https://github.com/RapDog64/webshop-automation-practice#readme) to the project.
